## Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

### Context
_____________
Perform data and exploratory analysis to derive insights and suggest strategies. The analysis will inform the stakeholders what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.

### Key Questions and Objectives
___________________
- What the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are, in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders?
- What time of the day people spend the most money?

use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? 
What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
often do they return to Instacart)?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
habits?
- What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
- What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer
profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products
customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
